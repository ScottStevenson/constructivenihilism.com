			<h1>Constructive Nihilism</h1>
			<h2>An open-source religion built on truth and pragmaticism</h2>
			<h3>Version 0.1</h3>
		</center>
		<hr/>
			<h4>1. Life has no meaning or purpose</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>There is no core axiom to derive meaning or purpose from. "Should" logic cannot be derived from the "is" logic. Our observation of reality only uncovers axioms for "is" logic.</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>2. All experiences, sensations and events are neutral</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Because life has no purpose, there is no reference context with which we can judge our experiences as "good" or "bad". We can't even say that pain is bad, or that pleasure is good.</li>
					<li>This fact is observable through meditation.</li>
					<li>Just because we are genetically programmed to be incentivized towards certain behaviours (eg. reproduction), this does not make those behaviours meaningful or purposeful.</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>3. Most of the time, most of us are unable to experience truths (1) and (2)</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Our innate nature is to be lost in artificial, human-made layers of meaning.</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>4. We can use the truths of (1) and (2) as tools to make all of our lives in the "artificial" world better</h3>
			Why not?<br/>
			In moments of clarity, we can:
				<ul>
					<li>Be infinitely content, knowing that since everything is neutral, it's also perfect.</li>
					<li>Be infinitely content, knowing that since there is no destination, we're already where we need to be.</li>
					<li>Take on ambitious projects to help the world, knowing that there are actually no risks.</li>
					<li>Be selfless, knowing that we have nothing to lose.</li>
					<li>Be creatively free, as we do not need to be puppets to our desires or false "purpose".</li> 
				</ul>

			<h3>FAQs</h3>
			<h4>Isn't this just Buddhism?</h4>
			I don't know! It's certainly a massive influence. Meditation and Buddhist writing has helped many uncover the above truths. However, I frequently found it too hard to direct others through the minefield through such spiritual writings. They are often fluffy, inconcise, conflicting, mystical and variable in quality - which ends up sacrificing truth - leaving too much room for interpretation. I wanted something any rational human being in 2018 could read and absorb in a few minutes. Many Buddhists also treat nihilism as an extreme to avoid.
