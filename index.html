			<h1>Constructive Nihilism</h1>
			<h2>An open-source religion built on truth and pragmaticism</h2>
			<h3>Version 0.1</h3>
		</center>
		<hr/>
			<h4>1. Life has no purpose</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>There is no foundational truth (a self-evident axiom) to derive meaning or purpose from. Our observation of reality only uncovers axioms about what <u>is</u>, not what <u>should be</u>. <u>Should</u> logic cannot be derived from <u>is</u> logic.</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>2. All experiences and sensations are neutral</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Since life has no purpose, there is no context with which we can judge our experiences as "good" or "bad". We're even unable to determine if pleasure is good, or that pain is bad.</li>
					<li>This is observable through meditation.</li>
					<li>We may be genetically programmed towards certain behaviors (eg. reproduction, pain avoidance), but this does not make those behaviours meaningful or purposeful.</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>3. 99% of the time, most of us are unable to fully experience truths (1) and (2)</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Our innate nature - our programming - ensures that we spend the vast majority of our mental time within artificial layers of meaning.</li>
					<li>Most of us will not achieve neverending "enlightenment".</li>
					<li>When very painful experiences hit us, we inevitably lose sight of the truth.</li>
					<li>When our brain injects axioms of meaning into our conciousness and we can't escape them, they become real to us.</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>4. Knowledge of (1) and (2) should be used to make all of our lives within "the matrix" better.</h3>
			This is the "constructive" part of Constructive Nihilism, and it's the biggest leap of faith that it asks for.<br/><br/>
			In moments of clarity, we can:
				<ul>
					<li>Take on ambitious projects to help ourselves and the world, knowing that we don't actually have anything to risk.</li>
					<li>Be selfless, knowing that our happiness doesn't need to be correlated with what we have.</li>
					<li>Be creatively free, as we do not need to be puppets to our desires or false "purpose".</li> 
					<li>Be infinitely content, knowing that since everything is neutral, it's also perfect.</li>
					<li>Be infinitely content, knowing that since there is no destination, we're already exactly where we need to be.</li>				
				</ul>

			We can cultivate these moments of clarity through meditation, directed reading and contemplation.

			<h3>FAQs</h3>
			<h4>Isn't this just Buddhism?</h4>
			I don't know! It's a big influence. Meditation and Buddhist writing have helped many uncover things similar to what is written above. However, I frequently found myself lost and confused in a minefield of spiritual writings. They are often fluffy, inconcise, conflicting, mystical and variable in quality - which ends up sacrificing truth - leaving too much room for interpretation. I wanted an uncomprimising foundation for belief that any rational human being could digest in a couple minutes.
