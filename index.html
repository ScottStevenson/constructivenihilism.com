			<h1>Constructive Nihilism</h1>
			<h2>An open-source religion built on truth and pragmaticism</h2>
			<h3>Version 0.1</h3>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
		Living rationally requires that we have a foundational set of truths, or axioms, to build on. The goal of this project is to produce a minimal set of such truths.
		</p><p>
		Other belief systems provide their practitioners with a set of foundational rules to reason from, however these are often not <b>self-evident</b> truths, but instead floating axioms that are meant to be blindly accepted and re-transmitted. They require <b>faith</b>, (or in blockchain lingo, they require <b>trust</b> in a centralized party ;) ).
		</p><p>
		Constructive Nihilism is meant to be "trustless". Any rationa party should be able to independently validate the claims it puts forward.
		</p><p>
		The philosophical viewpoint of nihilism is based on real, self-evident truth, however it is often associated with negativity and not seen as pragmatic. Constructive Nihilism seeks to combine the truth of nihilism with ideas that are considered traditionally positive and pragmatic.
		</p><p>
		As an <b>open-source</b> religion, Constructive Nihilism does not require any blind faith in floating axioms, or deontological rules. The full logic of this belief system, from its very core, is open for reading, debate, alteration and forking.
		</p><p>
		Everything here has been provided as a starting point for discussion. Constructive Nihilism is still just a seed of an idea, and we hope you'll <a href="https://github.com/ScottStevenson/constructivenihilism.com/">join</a> in helping it mature!
		</p>

		<h3>Axioms</h3>
		<h4>1. Life has no purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>There is no foundational truth (a self-evident axiom) to derive meaning or purpose from. Our observation of reality only uncovers axioms about what <u>is</u>, not what <u>should be</u>. <u>Should</u> logic cannot be derived from <u>is</u> logic.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>2. All experiences and sensations are neutral</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Since life has no purpose, there is no context with which we can judge our experiences as "good" or "bad". We're even unable to determine if pleasure is good, or if pain is bad.</li>
			<li>This is observable through meditation.</li>
			<li>We may be genetically programmed towards certain behaviors (eg. reproduction, pain avoidance), but this does not make those behaviours meaningful or purposeful.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>3. 99% of the time, most of us are unable to fully experience truths (1) and (2)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Our innate nature - our programming - ensures that we spend the vast majority of our mental time bound by artificial layers of meaning.</li>
			<li>Most of us will not achieve <u>neverending</u> "enlightenment" about the true nature of our existence.</li>
			<li>When very painful experiences hit us, we inevitably lose sight of the truth.</li>
			<li>When our brain injects axioms of meaning into our conciousness and we can't escape them, they become real to us.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>4. It is reasonable to use knowledge of (1) and (2) to make our lives within the inescapable, false layers of meaning, "better"</h3>
		This is the "constructive" part of Constructive Nihilism. Since we are so frequently trapped within a false context, and within that false context do feel "good" and "bad", it makes sense to use our knowledge of (1) and (2) as a superpower to make our lives within the false context "better". At the very least, there is no reason <u>not</u> to do this.<br/><br/>
		When we clearly see the truth about reality, we can:
		<ul>
			<li>Take on ambitious projects to help ourselves and the world, knowing that we don't actually have anything to risk.</li>
			<li>Be selfless, knowing that our happiness doesn't need to be correlated with what we have.</li>
			<li>Be creatively free, as we do not need to be puppets to our desires or false "purpose".</li> 
			<li>Be infinitely content, knowing that since everything is neutral, it's also perfect.</li>
			<li>Be infinitely content, knowing that since there is no destination, we're already exactly where we need to be.</li>				
		</ul>
		<p>We can cultivate clarity about the true nature of reality through reading, contemplation and meditation.</p>

		<h3>FAQs</h3>
		<h4>Isn't this just Buddhism (or belief system X)?</h4>
		<p>
		I don't know! It's certainly a big influence. Meditation and Buddhism have helped many uncover things similar to what is written above. However, I frequently found myself lost and confused in a minefield of spiritual writings. They are often fluffy, inconcise, conflicting, mystical and variable in quality - which ends up sacrificing truth - leaving too much room for interpretation. I wanted an uncomprimising foundation for belief that any rational human being could digest and extrapolate from in a couple minutes.
		</p><p>
		I also believe it is an incredibly valuable excercise to take inspiration from many belief systems that have stood the test of time, and to build a kernel of what really is important from those systems.
